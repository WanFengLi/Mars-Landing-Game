# Mars-Landing-Game-

This is a mouse-controlled game written purely in C for practice.

The objective of the game is to smoothly land the spacecraft at a designated location amidst numerous obstacles. By using the mouse, players can control the direction and speed of the spacecraft's movement. The position of the mouse relative to the spacecraft determines the direction of the thrust applied to the spacecraft, while the distance between the mouse and the spacecraft is directly proportional to the magnitude of the thrust exerted on the spacecraft.

The game consists of seven levels, each presenting unique challenges such as peculiar terrains, intense gravity, shifting winds, aggressive extraterrestrial spacecraft, blazing stars, and more. Players can choose to tackle the challenges one by one or opt for a level-select approach. The results of successfully overcoming each challenge are timed, with shorter completion times resulting in higher scores upon successful completion of the entire game.

As this is a training exercise, almost every line of code is accompanied by detailed comments.
